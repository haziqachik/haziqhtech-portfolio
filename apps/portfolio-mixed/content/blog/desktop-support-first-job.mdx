Fresh out of polytechnic in 2016, I landed my first real job as a Desktop Support Engineer at NCS. I thought I knew what IT work looked like from my internship, but working full-time in an enterprise environment was completely different. Here's what I actually did and what I learned during those crucial first 7 months.

## The Reality Check: Enterprise IT vs. Student Projects

**What I Expected:**
- Fixing interesting technical problems
- Working with cool enterprise systems
- Applying all the networking theory I'd studied

**What I Actually Got:**
- Lots of "have you tried turning it off and on again?"
- Printer problems. So many printer problems.
- Users who were frustrated and needed patience, not technical lectures

## Daily Life as Desktop Support

### The Morning Routine
Every day started with checking the helpdesk queue. As a junior support engineer, I got assigned the "Level 1" tickets - basic issues that senior staff could handle in their sleep but were still learning experiences for me.

**Typical Day Breakdown:**
- **30% Password resets and account lockouts** - Boring but taught me Active Directory basics
- **25% Hardware issues** - Computers not starting, peripherals not working, replacement requests
- **20% Software problems** - Applications crashing, installation issues, compatibility problems
- **15% Network connectivity** - WiFi problems, VPN issues, printer connections
- **10% "Everything else"** - The weird stuff that made the job interesting

### The Learning Curve: Technical Skills

**What I Actually Learned:**
1. **Windows Domain Management:** How enterprise networks actually work vs. the theory
2. **Hardware Troubleshooting:** Systematic approach to diagnosing problems
3. **Software Installation:** Enterprise deployment vs. just downloading and clicking install
4. **Basic Networking:** Why WiFi stops working and how to fix it
5. **Documentation:** How to write tickets that actually help the next person

### The Harder Lesson: People Skills

The biggest shock was realizing that technical skills were only half the job. Most of my time was spent dealing with people who were:
- Frustrated their computer wasn't working
- Stressed about deadlines and couldn't afford downtime
- Not technical and needed explanations they could understand
- Sometimes taking their frustration out on the IT person (me)

**Communication Lessons I Had to Learn:**
- How to explain technical problems without using jargon
- When to apologize for system issues (even if they weren't my fault)
- How to set realistic expectations for resolution times
- The importance of following up and confirming issues were fixed

## The Projects That Taught Me the Most

### Hardware Refresh Initiative
When the company decided to replace 50+ old computers, I got involved in the rollout process. This wasn't glamorous work, but it taught me:

**Planning and Logistics:**
- How to coordinate with users to minimize disruption
- Importance of testing everything before deployment
- Creating standard imaging procedures to save time
- Backup and data migration processes

**What "Reduced Setup Time by 40%" Actually Meant:**
- We went from 3 hours per machine to about 1.8 hours
- This was mainly because I created a checklist and standardized the process
- Also learned keyboard shortcuts and got faster at the routine stuff

### Barcode Asset Tracking System
The company was losing track of equipment, so we implemented barcode scanning for inventory management.

**My Role:**
- Scanning existing equipment and updating the database
- Creating labels for new equipment
- Training users on the check-in/check-out process
- Running monthly inventory reports

**What "Improved Accuracy from 85% to 98%" Actually Meant:**
- Before: People forgot to report when equipment moved or broke
- After: Systematic scanning made it harder to lose track of things
- The 98% was based on monthly physical counts vs. database records

## Email Communication and Professional Development

One thing that surprised me was how much time I spent writing emails. Every ticket resolution, every status update, every escalation - it all went through email.

**Email Skills I Developed:**
- How to write professional updates to supervisors
- Explaining technical issues to non-technical managers
- Documenting solutions for future reference
- Escalation procedures when I couldn't solve something

**Sample Email Style I Learned:**
```
Hi [Supervisor Name],

Update on ticket #12345 - User reported computer not starting

RESOLUTION: Identified faulty power supply. Replaced unit and confirmed system boots normally. User back up and running as of 2:30 PM.

FOLLOW-UP: Will check with user tomorrow to confirm no additional issues.

Thanks,
Haziq
```

## The Recognition and What It Actually Meant

I received recognition from NCS for my work, but let me be honest about what that represented:
- **Consistent performance** on basic support tasks
- **Good communication** with users and supervisors  
- **Reliable follow-through** on assigned tickets
- **Willingness to learn** and take on additional responsibilities

It wasn't about being a technical genius - it was about being dependable and professional in a junior role.

## What I Actually Learned About Enterprise IT

### Technical Reality
- **Enterprise systems are complex** but most daily issues are simple
- **Documentation is crucial** because you'll forget the solution to weird problems
- **Testing everything** before deploying saves huge amounts of time later
- **Standardized processes** are more important than individual brilliance

### Professional Reality
- **Communication skills** matter as much as technical knowledge
- **User satisfaction** often depends more on service attitude than technical perfection
- **Teamwork** means knowing when to escalate and when to persist
- **Professional growth** comes from consistently doing good work on routine tasks

## Preparing for the Next Step

By the end of 2016, I felt ready for something more challenging. The desktop support role had taught me:
- **How enterprise IT actually works** (vs. textbook theory)
- **Professional communication skills** that worked in business environments
- **Systematic troubleshooting** approaches that I still use today
- **Confidence** that I could handle technical problems under pressure

The role also showed me what I wanted to move toward - automation and development work rather than daily support tickets.

## Looking Back: Why This Experience Mattered

This wasn't the most exciting job, but it was exactly what I needed as a fresh graduate:
- **Professional foundation** in a structured environment
- **Real-world experience** with enterprise systems and processes
- **Communication skills** that every tech role requires
- **Confidence** that I could succeed in professional environments

Most importantly, it taught me that success in IT isn't just about technical knowledge - it's about being reliable, professional, and focused on solving problems for real people with real deadlines.

The skills I learned doing desktop support - systematic troubleshooting, clear communication, professional follow-through - became the foundation for everything that came after, from government automation work to maritime operations and now cybersecurity.
