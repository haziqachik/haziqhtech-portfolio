When a dashboard is going to be consumed by regulators, I follow a security-first deployment sequence. Here are the repeatable checks I run before any dataset goes live:

1. **Row-level security rehearsal.** I validate role assignments against synthetic records so no one sees out-of-band rows. PowerShell scripts help export the membership matrix ead-hoc for review.
2. **Data gateway verification.** A small Azure Automation runbook pings the enterprise gateway and checks the run history for the past seven days. If I spot failures, I investigate before final publish.
3. **MFA coverage.** Licensing reviews and Azure AD sign-in logs confirm that every intended viewer has multi-factor auth enforced. If they don't, I block access until they do.
4. **Operational logging.** Power BI activity logs feed a Log Analytics workspace. I add alert rules for unusual download volumes or export attempts.

Only after all four controls pass muster do I hand dashboards to stakeholders. The whole workflow is documented in Confluence so anyone can rerun it without waiting for me."
