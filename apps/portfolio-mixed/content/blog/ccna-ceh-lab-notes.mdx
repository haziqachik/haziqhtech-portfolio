I rotate between **Cisco Packet Tracer** and a small **Proxmox cluster** when mapping out new labs. The goal: reinforce core routing concepts while layering ethical hacking techniques on top.

- **Packet Tracer for design speed.** I sketch topologies quickly, experiment with OSPF areas, and document the expected routing tables.
- **GNS3 with real images.** For scenarios that require IOS features missing in Packet Tracer, I switch to GNS3 to run full `show` and `debug` commands.
- **Azure and AttackBox.** Security labs live in disposable VMs. I spin up Windows Server, Ubuntu, and Kali variants, snapshotting between stages so rollback is painless.
- **Evidence and automation.** Python + Netmiko captures `show` outputs after each change, while Obsidian stores the markdown runbooks.

Treating the lab like production — with tickets, evidence folders, and QA checklists — keeps the habits sharp while I prep for certification exams.
