In July 2019, I made the jump from desktop support at NCS to Software Engineer at GovTech. This wasn't just a job change - it was moving from fixing individual computer problems to building automation systems for government agencies. Here's what that transition actually looked like and what I learned about RPA development in a government context.

## The Big Leap: From Support to Development

**Why I Applied to GovTech:**
- Wanted to move from fixing things to building things
- Government work seemed stable and meaningful
- Chance to learn automation and development skills
- Opportunity to work on systems that actually mattered

**What I Didn't Expect:**
- How different building automation is from basic IT support
- The complexity of government systems and compliance requirements
- How much I'd need to learn about process analysis and workflow design

## Learning UiPath: From Zero to Functional

When I started at GovTech, I had never used UiPath before. My background was desktop support and basic network administration. Suddenly I was expected to build automations for government workflows.

### The Learning Process (Reality Check)

**Week 1-2: Basic Training**
- UiPath Studio interface and basic activities
- Recording simple workflows
- Understanding variables and arguments
- Lots of YouTube tutorials and documentation reading

**Week 3-4: First Attempts**
- Trying to automate simple tasks like data entry
- Discovering how unreliable web selectors can be
- Learning about exception handling (the hard way)
- Realizing automation is harder than it looks

**Month 2-3: Getting Functional**
- Building workflows that actually worked consistently
- Understanding government system quirks and workarounds
- Learning proper error handling and logging
- Starting to help colleagues with their automation needs

## The SG Work Pass Project: What 5,000+ Records Actually Meant

My biggest project was building automations for SG Work Pass processing. The "5,000+ records per run" sounds impressive, but let me explain what that actually involved:

### The Real Challenge
**The Problem:**
- Government officers were manually processing work pass applications
- Each application required data entry across multiple systems
- Manual process was slow and prone to errors
- Officers were working overtime to keep up with volume

**My Solution (Learning as I Went):**
```
1. Built UiPath workflow to read application data from Excel
2. Automated data entry into the government portal
3. Added error handling for common portal issues
4. Created logging to track which records processed successfully
5. Built simple reporting for officers to review results
```

**What "Processing 5,000+ Records" Actually Meant:**
- The automation ran overnight when portal traffic was lower
- It could process about 200-300 records per hour (vs. ~20 manually)
- Officers still needed to review and approve each case
- My job was eliminating the repetitive data entry, not making decisions

### Technical Reality vs. Expectations

**What Worked Well:**
- Consistent data entry without typos
- Processing during off-peak hours
- Detailed logs for tracking and auditing
- Freed up officers for more complex cases

**What Was Challenging:**
- Government portals aren't designed for automation
- Web elements changed without notice
- Network timeouts and system maintenance windows
- Different workflows for different visa types

## Ministry of Manpower: The "Automation Clinics" Experience

In February 2020, I moved to MOM as an IT Officer. This is where I ran the "15 automation clinics" that saved "120 staff hours per quarter."

### What "Automation Clinics" Actually Were

These weren't formal training sessions - they were more like problem-solving workshops where I'd meet with different teams to understand their repetitive tasks and see if automation could help.

**Typical Clinic Format:**
1. **Meet with team lead** - understand their current process
2. **Watch someone do the task** - see where the bottlenecks are
3. **Identify automation opportunities** - what parts can be automated
4. **Build a simple prototype** - usually took 1-2 days
5. **Test with the team** - refine based on their feedback
6. **Document the process** - so they could maintain it

### Real Examples of What I Automated

**Workforce Data Compilation:**
- Teams were manually copying data from multiple Excel files
- Built UiPath workflow to merge files and generate standard reports
- Reduced 3-hour monthly task to 30 minutes

**Email Distribution for Surveys:**
- Officers were manually sending survey links to contact lists
- Created automation to personalize and send emails in batches
- Added tracking to see who responded

**Document Processing:**
- Teams were manually extracting data from PDF forms
- Built workflow to extract key information and populate spreadsheets
- Added quality checks to flag unusual entries for manual review

### What "120 Staff Hours Saved Per Quarter" Actually Meant

This wasn't a precise calculation - it was an estimate based on:
- Time savings reported by teams after implementing automations
- Rough calculation of minutes saved per task Ã— frequency
- Feedback from supervisors about reduced overtime

The real value wasn't just time savings - it was:
- **Reduced errors** in repetitive data tasks
- **Better job satisfaction** - people preferred interesting work to data entry
- **Consistency** in processes across different teams
- **Learning opportunity** for staff to understand automation potential

## The Technical Skills I Actually Developed

### UiPath Development
- **Basic workflow design** - understanding sequence vs. flowchart
- **Web automation** - dealing with dynamic selectors and timeouts
- **Excel automation** - reading, writing, and formatting spreadsheets
- **Email integration** - sending automated notifications and reports
- **Error handling** - making workflows robust enough for production use

### Government System Integration
- **Understanding compliance requirements** - audit trails and security
- **Working with legacy systems** - systems that weren't designed for automation
- **Testing procedures** - how to validate automations in government context
- **Documentation standards** - what government agencies need for process documentation

### Process Analysis
- **Workflow mapping** - understanding how work actually gets done
- **Identifying bottlenecks** - where automation can make the biggest impact
- **Change management** - helping people adapt to new automated processes
- **Stakeholder communication** - explaining technical solutions to non-technical audiences

## The Video Training Component

Part of my job was creating training materials for non-technical teams. This was actually harder than building the automations:

**What I Had to Learn:**
- How to break down technical processes into simple steps
- Screen recording and basic video editing
- Writing user manuals that people would actually read
- Conducting training sessions for groups with different technical backgrounds

**The Challenge:**
Government officers needed to understand enough about the automation to:
- Know when it was working correctly
- Recognize when something went wrong
- Perform basic troubleshooting
- Know when to escalate issues

## Recognition and What It Actually Represented

I received testimonials from both GovTech and MOM. Here's what that recognition was really about:

**At GovTech:**
- Successfully delivering the Work Pass automation project on time
- Learning UiPath quickly enough to be productive
- Good communication with technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Willingness to support other teams with their automation needs

**At MOM:**
- Running effective automation clinics that teams actually found useful
- Building automations that were robust enough for daily use
- Training teams to use and maintain the solutions
- Professional approach to stakeholder management

## Looking Back: What This Experience Actually Taught Me

### Technical Lessons
- **Automation is harder than it looks** - especially making it reliable
- **Understanding the business process** is more important than technical perfection
- **User adoption** determines success more than technical sophistication
- **Documentation and training** are as important as the automation itself

### Professional Lessons
- **Government work has different requirements** - security, audit trails, compliance
- **Stakeholder management** is crucial when implementing process changes
- **Change management** - people need to understand and trust automation before they'll use it
- **Cross-agency collaboration** - how different government departments work together

### Career Development
This experience taught me that I enjoyed:
- **Problem-solving** more than routine maintenance
- **Building things** more than fixing things
- **Process improvement** and understanding how work flows
- **Training and knowledge transfer** - helping people understand new tools

It also showed me areas I wanted to explore further:
- **Security aspects** of automation and government systems
- **Data analysis** and understanding patterns in large datasets
- **System integration** and how different technologies work together

## The Foundation for What Came Next

The RPA experience at GovTech and MOM became the foundation for everything that followed:
- **Systematic thinking** about processes and workflows
- **Understanding government requirements** for security and compliance
- **Communication skills** for explaining technical concepts to diverse audiences
- **Problem-solving approach** that focuses on real business needs

When I later moved into maritime security with the Police Force, the process analysis and systematic thinking skills from automation work translated directly to understanding operational procedures and security protocols.

Now, as I'm developing cybersecurity skills, the automation experience helps me understand:
- How systems integrate and where vulnerabilities might exist
- The importance of audit trails and compliance in security contexts
- How to analyze processes to identify security risks
- The need for systematic approaches to complex technical problems
