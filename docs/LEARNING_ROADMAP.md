## 🔄 How to Reset and Start Over

### **Complete Reset:**

rm -rf apps/portfolio-mixed/src
rm -rf apps/portfolio-mixed/prisma

# 3. Start fresh
npx create-next-app@latest apps/my-portfolio --typescript --tailwind --app

# 4. Follow Phase 1 above
```

### **Partial Reset (Keep specific features):**
```bash
# Reset just the database
rm -rf prisma/
rm apps/portfolio-mixed/src/lib/database.ts

# Reset just the UI
rm -rf apps/portfolio-mixed/src/components/
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Learning

1. **Commit Often**: Every small working feature should be committed
2. **Read Error Messages**: They're teaching you what's wrong
3. **Use TypeScript**: It prevents bugs and teaches you proper types
4. **Test Everything**: Visit every page, click every button
5. **Ask "Why?"**: Don't just copy code, understand what each line does

---

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

1. **Choose your learning path** (A, B, or C above)
2. **Set up your workspace** (fresh folder or clone ours)
3. **Start with Phase 1** (basic Next.js app)
4. **Track progress** with git commits
5. **Use this roadmap** to check your progress

Remember: **Building software is like learning to drive**. You need theory (reading code) AND practice (writing code). Our codebase is your reference manual - use it wisely!
